This mobile application implements a simplified version of Dynamo-style key-value storage for upto 5 mobile devices acting as Nodes. There are three main pieces that are implemented: 1) Partitioning, 2) Replication, and 3) Failure handling.

The main goal is to provide both availability and linearizability at the same time. In other words, this application always performs read and write operations successfully even under node failures. At the same time, a read operation always returns the most recent value. At a time only one device fails, but many devices can fail during the time application is running. The failed nodes can join the currently active nodes and recover the lost data using replicated data. The partitioning and replication is done exactly the way Dynamo does. The replication is done in 2 nodes. It supports insert, delete, query, concurrent operations and recovery in up to 5 nodes using consistent hashing.
